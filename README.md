# Spring 2022 NBER Workshop

This repo contains code for the tutorials of the Spring 2022 heterogeneous-agent macro workshop at the NBER taught by Adrien Auclert, Bence BardoÃÅczy, Michael Cai, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub.

An agenda for the workshop is available here:

This is also where we will post lecture notes and other reading materials.

# Installation

If you are relatively new to Python, we recommend having the [Anaconda distribution of Python installed](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to make sure you have all necessary libraries. 

There are many outstanding resources you can find online, but two good introductory resources are the [introductory lecture series at QuantEcon](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) and the [Python data science handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (ignoring the machine learning content in the latter). 

If you are accustomed to Matlab or Julia, QuantEcon's [Matlab-Python-Julia cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/) can be useful, as can [NumPy for Matlab users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) (ignoring now-obsolete "matrix" class at the end). 

Overall, a good goal prior to the workshop is to make sure that you can run and mostly follow the [Standard Incomplete Markets Steady State notebook](https://github.com/shade-econ/nber-workshop-2022/blob/main/Tutorials/Tutorial%200%20Standard%20Incomplete%20Markets%20Steady%20State.ipynb), which covers the initial material of the class and does not require our SSJ toolkit.
